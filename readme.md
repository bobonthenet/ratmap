# Rat map is an interactive vermin sighting map
When you see a rat, submit your sighting with a location.  This will help identify where vermin populations are concentrated and identify where there are most likely to be nests.

##Development Plan:
I want to get the core functionality working such as the UI changes and securing the app to prevent hacking then release this thing to the public.  After that I'll make improvements based on a request/bounty system.  If users pay me I'll make the improvement.  Bug fixes will be free.

## Todo:
* Form validation
* Improve UI
* Other stuff maybe if incentivized.
  * Option to mark vermin sighting as dead or killed.
  * Show info when you click on vermin icon.
  * Log in and share vermin kill count.
  * Sightings for other vermin.
  * Unique URL instead of subdomain.
  * On mobile take photos and have the photo show when you click the location.
  * On mobile have the location data populate automatically if available.
