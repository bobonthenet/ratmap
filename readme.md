# Rat map is an interactive vermin sighting map
When you see a rat, submit your sighting with a location.  This will help identify where vermin populations are concentrated and identify where there are most likely to be nests.

## Todo:
* Form validation
* Improve UI
* Other stuff maybe if incentivized.
  * Option to mark vermin sighting as dead or killed.
  * Show info when you click on vermin icon.
  * Log in and share vermin kill count.
  * Sightings for other vermin.
  * Unique URL instead of subdomain.
